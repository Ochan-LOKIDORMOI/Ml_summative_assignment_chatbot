## **Chatbot Purpose and Domain Alignment**
This chatbot is a domain-specific conversational agent trained on **3,000** queries related to the healthcare and finance sectors.

It aims to provide automated responses to common user inquiries, improving accessibility and efficiency in these industries.

The dataset is structured into four key columns:
- **Query:** User input representing real-world questions.
- **Response:** Predefined chatbot answers.
- **Intent:** Categorization of query purpose.
- **Domain:** Context classification (e.g., healthcare, finance).
